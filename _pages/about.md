In an attempt to start contributing back to the security community, I am starting a new blog series about Red Teaming for and with Macs. Macs seem to be more and more popular, but most red teaming blogs are exclusively Windows based. In conjunction with these blog posts, I will be releasing tools to help with red teamers on Macs.
